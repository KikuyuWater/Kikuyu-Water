            The Company's water supply is sourced exclusively from groundwater through forty-three (43) developed boreholes, of which thirty-one (31) are currently operational. As part of its operational efficiency and climate-resilience measures, a number of boreholes have been solarised, namely Twin Island 1, Twin Island 2, Twin Gichuru 1, Twin Gichuru 2, Ondiri_Mai ai Hii, Thogoto Cloister, Riu 2, Thirime, and Nduma. In addition, further boreholes—including Ondiri 1, Ondiri 3, Riu 1, Riu 5, Karai Renguti, Muthiga, Kikuyu Market, Kiambaa Market, and Ondiri Police Post—are at various stages of solarisation. Five (5) boreholes have been decommissioned due to low yield in accordance with approved resource management and operational efficiency guidelines.
